[kubelet-check] Initial timeout of 40s passed.

	Unfortunately, an error has occurred:
		timed out waiting for the condition

	This error is likely caused by:
		- The kubelet is not running
		- The kubelet is unhealthy due to a misconfiguration of the node in some way (required cgroups disabled)

	If you are on a systemd-powered system, you can try to troubleshoot the error with the following commands:
		- 'systemctl status kubelet'
		- 'journalctl -xeu kubelet'

	Additionally, a control plane component may have crashed or exited when started by the container runtime.
	To troubleshoot, list all containers using your preferred container runtimes CLI.

	Here is one example how you may list all Kubernetes containers running in docker:
		- 'docker ps -a | grep kube | grep -v pause'
		Once you have found the failing container, you can inspect its logs with:
		- 'docker logs CONTAINERID'

Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 172.16.62.205:6443 --token vqzy3u.k14klb3fqnrqoz0z \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:235710bca6f3a24c234b7b5ce482d3c1c78bc32a286bf66678d2f7cd858b3074
